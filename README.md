# Tally App

The Tally App is a simple web application that helps users keep track of their grocery expenses. It allows users to add items to a list, along with their respective prices, and then calculates the total cost of all the items. Users can also delete individual items or clear the entire list.

<h2>Files</h2>

index.html
This file is the main HTML file for the Tally App. It contains the structure of the app, including the form for adding items, the table for displaying items and their prices, and the button for clearing the list. The file also includes a link to the CSS stylesheet and a script tag that loads the JavaScript code for the app.

style.css
This file contains the CSS code that styles the HTML elements in the Tally App. It sets the font family, font size, and colors for the headings, labels, input fields, and buttons. It also styles the table and its elements, including the header row, the body rows, and the footer row.

script.js
This file contains the JavaScript code that provides the interactivity for the Tally App. It defines three functions: addItem, deleteRow, and clearList. The addItem function is called when the user submits the form, and it adds a new row to the table with the item name and price entered by the user. The deleteRow function is called when the user clicks the delete button in a row, and it removes the row from the table. The clearList function is called when the user clicks the Clear List button, and it removes all rows from the table and resets the total cost to zero.

Overall, the Tally App is a simple but useful tool for keeping track of grocery expenses. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files work together to provide a user-friendly interface and a seamless experience for the user.
